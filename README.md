# Text-Generation-with-Markow-Chains
This project implements text generation using Markov Chains, a probabilistic model that generates new text by predicting the next word based on the current state and learned transition probabilities from training data.
# Text Generation with Markov Chains

## Overview
This project implements a **simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains**. The model generates text by predicting the next word or character based on the probability distribution learned from previously seen sequences in the input data.

Markov Chains provide a statistical approach to text generation and help in understanding the fundamentals of probabilistic language models.
